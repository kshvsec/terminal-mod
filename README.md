# TERMINAL SKIN
- Repo actively maintained
- Coded in python
- Clone and run "main.py"

# ALLOW TO ACCESS FILES
- Clone the repo and cut paste it in the root directory to allow access to all the files. Since it is just a skin and not a generic terminal
- I will probably be adding some custom commands soon
